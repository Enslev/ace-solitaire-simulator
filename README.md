# Ace Solitaire Simulator

Since I learned this type of solitaire, I have always wondered what the chances of actually winning was, since it almost never seemed to happen.

Finally I got fed up with not knowing, and now this exsists.

It consists of four parts
- The card deck itself
- The solitaire class containing the rules of the game
- The simulator
- Several (eventually..) strategies to be used by the simulator

With the current basic strategy, the chances of winning seems to convergate towards around 0.5%, so no wonder I never seemed to win.
